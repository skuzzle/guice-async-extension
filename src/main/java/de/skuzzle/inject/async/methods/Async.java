/**
 * Tags a method to be run asynchronously. Annotated methods must return either a
 * {@link Future} or no value (void or {@link Void}). To enable asynchronous method
 * support, use {@link GuiceAsync#enableFor(com.google.inject.Binder)} in any of your
 * modules.
 * <p>
 * Method calls are intercepted and the call is then executed in a different thread using
 * an {@link ExecutorService}. The ExecutorService instance that will be used is looked up
 * using the {@link Injector}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Specifying the Executor</h2> It is possible to customize the look-up {@link Key}
 * that is used to retrieve the actual ExecutorService.
 * <ul>
 * <li>You can put any {@link BindingAnnotation} including {@link Named} on the method to
 * specify the annotation part of the Key.</li>
 * <li>If you need to reference a certain ExecutorService sub type, you can use
 * {@link Executor} to specify the class part of the Key.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * For example, your method may look like:
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;Async
 * &#64;Named("computationExecutor")
 * &#64;Executor(AdvancedExecutorService.class)
 * public void compute() {...}
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * In this case, the Executor to use will be looked up like
 * {@code injector.getInstance(Key.get(AdvancedExecutorService.class,
 *      Names.named("computationExecutor"))}
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you leave out the {@link Executor} part, the class defaults to
 * {@code ExecutorService.class}. If you leave out the binding annotation, the created key
 * will not have an annotation part. If you put neither a binding annotation nor an
 * Executor class on the method, a default ExecutorService is used that is created
 * internally. You should make no assumptions about the actual behavior of that service
 * and it is highly recommended to bind and specify an ExecutorService yourself.
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * public class MyModule extends AbstractModule {
 *     &#64;Provides
 *     public ThreadFactory provideMyThreadFactory() {
 *         return new ThreadFactoryBuilder()....build(); // class from Google guava
 *     }
 *
 *     &#64;Provides
 *     &#64;Named("mainThreadPool")
 *     public ExecutorService provideMyExecutor(ThreadFactory threadFactory) {
 *         return Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4, threadFactory);
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Returning values</h2> You can return a value from an asynchronous method by
 * returning a {@link Future} object. To implement such a method, you can obtain a Future
 * for an arbitrary value using {@link Futures#delegate(Object)} like in:
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;Async
 * public Future&lt;Double&gt; compute() {
 *     final double result = realComputation();
 *     return Futures.delegate(result);
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * The dummy Future object created here will be replaced with a real Future object that is
 * obtained from the ExecutorService.
 * 
 * <p>
 * It's also possible to return a {@link CompletableFuture}:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * &#64;Async
 * public CompletableFuture&lt;Double&gt; compute() {
 *     final double result = realComputation();
 *     return Futures.delegateCompletable(result);
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Thread safety</h2> As your method is executed asynchronously, special care has to
 * be taken to ensure thread safety of that operation. Beware of the following:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Do not access attributes of the surrounding class. If you do, use synchronization
 * to ensure visibility of the data that you write and read.</li>
 * <li>Parameters that are passed to the asynchronous method are also transferred to the
 * executing thread. Thus, all actual parameters must be thread safe. That is, they must
 * use synchronization and/or volatile declarations to ensure integrity and visibility of
 * the data that is written and read.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Exception handling</h2> Asynchronous methods can throw checked exceptions. If they
 * do, the exception will be wrapped in an {@link ExecutionException} which will be thrown
 * by {@link Future#get()}.
 *
 * <p>
 * This annotation is subject to all limitations that apply to {@link MethodInterceptor
 * MethodInterceptors}. Please see the guice wiki for more information.
 * </p>
